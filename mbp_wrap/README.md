# mbp_wrap

this is a cord wrap for a 96w charger for a macbook pro m1 laptop.

i designed the tolerances to use a tpu material so it would hug the charger tightly.

### fabrication

- brand: overture
- material: tpu
- filament diameter: 1.75mm
- infill: 40+% -- more infill --> longer print time --> more structural, i personally found 40% to be sufficient
